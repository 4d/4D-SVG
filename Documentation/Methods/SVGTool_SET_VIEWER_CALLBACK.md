The SVGTool\_SET\_VIEWER\_CALLBACK command is used to install *methodName* as the project method that will be called when the On Clicked and On Mouse Move events occur on the image displayed by the *SVGTool\_SHOW\_IN\_VIEWER* command. 

This method receives a text parameter that is the ID of the element being clicked or over which the mouse is moving as provided by the 4D *SVG Find element ID by coordinates* command. 

This parameter must be declared in the *methodName* project method of the host database by inserting it into the line C\_TEXT($1).

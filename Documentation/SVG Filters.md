SVG Filters

### ![](..Home.md..Home.mdimageHome.mdarticle16x16Home.mdak_200.png) SVG Filters Â 

The commands of the "[Filters](Filters.md "Filters")" theme can be used to set filter effects that are applicable to the SVG elements. A filter effect consists of a succession of graphic operations, applied to a source graphic, which produces a modified graphic.

The result of the filter effect is rendered on the target device in place of the original source graphic.

A filter is set using the [SVG_Define_filter](SVG_Define_filter.md "SVG_Define_filter") command, found in the "[Structure and Definitions](Structure%20and%20Definitions.md "Structure and Definitions")" theme, and is applied using the [SVG_SET_FILTER](SVG_Define_filter](SVG_Define_filter.md "SVG_Define_filter") command, found in the "[Structure and Definitions](Structure%20and%20Definitions.md "Structure and Definitions")" theme, and is applied using the [SVG_SET_FILTER.md)  command, found in the "[Attributes](Attributes.md "Attributes")" theme. The commands of the "[Filters](Filters.md "Filters")" theme are used to construct filtering operations or "filter primitives".

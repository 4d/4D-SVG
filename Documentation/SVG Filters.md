# ðŸ§© SVG Filters Â 

The commands of the filters theme can be used to set filter effects that are applicable to the SVG elements. A filter effect consists of a succession of graphic operations, applied to a source graphic, which produces a modified graphic.

The result of the filter effect is rendered on the target device in place of the original source graphic.

A filter is set using the [SVG_Define_filter](Methods/SVG_Define_filter.md) command, found in the "[Structure and Definitions](Structure%20and%20Definitions.md)" theme, and is applied using the [SVG_SET_FILTER](Methods/SVG_SET_FILTER.md) [SVG_Define_filter](Methods/SVG_Define_filter.md) command, found in the "[Structure and Definitions](Structure%20and%20Definitions.md)" theme, and is applied using the [SVG_SET_FILTER](Methods/SVG_SET_FILTER.md)  command, found in the "[Attributes](Attributes.md)" theme. The commands of the filters theme are used to construct filtering operations or "filter primitives".
